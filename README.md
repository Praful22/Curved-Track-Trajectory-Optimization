# Curved Track Trajectory Optimization

<img src="https://github.com/av-course/HW2/blob/main/CurvedTrackTrajectoryOptimization.gif" />

The project task is to work on the curved-track, and create the trajectory optimization procedure in a manner that adheres to the curved lane boundaries using IPOPT solver.

Objectives:
1. Formulation and expression of circular lane-boundary constraint. 
2. Incorporation of the above constraint into the generation of motion planning problems.


Assumptions: In the Curved lane world, the other vehicles on the road will deviate from the constant-velocity predictions that the planner assumes.

Final Product:
 A video/gif demonstrating resulting trajectory planner working on the cirlce track.
